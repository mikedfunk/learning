# Go to file under cursor

* `gf` - Edit existing file under cursor in same window
* `<C-W>f` - Edit existing file under cursor in split window
* `<C-W><C-F>` - Edit existing file under cursor in split window
* `<C-W>gf` - Edit existing file under cursor in new tabpage

There is no standard mapping to edit existing file under cursor in a vertical split, but you can achieve it by first splitting the window vertically and then editing the file under cursor in the current window.
* `<C-W>v+gf` - Edit existing file under cursor in vertically split window
