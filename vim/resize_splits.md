# Resize Splits

* `<c-w> >` to resize a vertical split right
* `<c-w> <` to resize a vertical split left
* `<c-w> -` to reduce the height of a vertical split
* `<c-w> +` to increase the height of a vertical split

These also take multipliers so you can do `<c-w> 10 -`. You can do it the other way too: `30<c-w> +`. Or if you have mouse enabled you can just drag the border.
