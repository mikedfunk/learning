# Using vim help

* `:helpgrep myterm`, then `:copen` to see the list of matches, `:cnext` for the next one, `:cclose` to close quickfix
* `:help ctrl-w` for help with a known helpdoc. 
* Conventions are like `ctrl-w_ctrl-f` or `v_i` for i in visual mode or `<Esc>` for special chars
* `c-]` to follow a link
* `c-o` to go back
