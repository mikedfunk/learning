# Vim built-in completion

From insert mode:

## Completion

* `<c-x><c-o>` omnicompletion
* `<c-x><c-l>` whole line completion e.g. start at the beginning of a line, type a few chars from the beginning of another line, and hit the key combo. It will complete the entire other line!
* `<c-x><c-f>` file completion
* `<c-x><c-]` tag completion

## Sort of meta-completion

* `<c-n>` next match for word under cursor
* `<c-p>` previous match for word under the cursor
* `<c-x><c-n>` continues the last completion with the next _word_ from that completion
* `<c-x><c-p>` continues the last completion with the previous _word_ from that completion

## Others

* `<c-x><c-k>` keywords in 'dictionary'
* `<c-x><c-t>` keywords in 'thesaurus', thesaurus-style
* `<c-x><c-i>` keywords in the current and included files
* `<c-x><c-d>` definitions or macros
* `<c-x><c-v>` Vim command-line
* `<c-x><c-u>` User defined completion
* `<c-x>s` Spelling suggestions

## Etc

* `<c-e>` Cancel completion
* `<c-y>` Accept the current completion
