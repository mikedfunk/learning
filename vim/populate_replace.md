# Populate replace dialog

You can populate the vim replace command (or any command) with data from other places, e.g.

```
:s/|<-- cursor here: press <c-r><c-w> for the word under the cursor or <c-r><c-a> for the WORD under the cursor
```

Pneumonic: it's the opposite of `<c-w><c-r>` to rotate windows
