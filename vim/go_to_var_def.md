# Go to variable definition

* `gd` will take you to the local declaration.
* `gD` will take you to the global declaration.
* `g*` search for the word under the cursor (like *, but g* on 'rain' will find words like 'rainbow').
* `g#` same as g* but in backward direction.
* `ctrl-w i` will go to definition in a horizontal split
